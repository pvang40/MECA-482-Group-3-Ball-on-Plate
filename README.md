## 1. Introduction 
Control system theories are applied to many applications to help improve productivity and enhance today’s technology. This report will display the importance and necessary components of control system design through mathematical and simulation modeling. The goal of the project is to develop a comprehensive solution to control a ball’s position on a self-stabilizing flat plate. The ball on plate system consists of a plate that will be tilted using two servo motors to control the plate across the x and y directions as well as a camera to act as a sensor. The models provided in this report will not include the sensor. All models and controls are based off of the operational viewpoint.

## 2. Capabilities Database
The design is simple but effective.
The camera works as a sensor to detect the position of the ball
The rotary servos will be connected to the plate allowing for movement of the plate in all directions.
The main support beam, which is stationary, provides support to the platform to ensure a leveled base.
The servos will be attached to the base and slightly under the plate to keep the design compact as well as aid in sufficient support for the platform assembly.
