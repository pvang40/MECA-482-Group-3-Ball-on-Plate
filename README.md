## 1. Introduction 
The goal of this project is to 

## 2. Capabilities Database
The design is simple but effective.
The camera works as a sensor to detect the position of the ball
The rotary servos will be connected to the plate allowing for movement of the plate in all directions.
The main support beam, which is stationary, provides support to the platform to ensure a leveled base.
The servos will be attached to the base and slightly under the plate to keep the design compact as well as aid in sufficient support for the platform assembly.
